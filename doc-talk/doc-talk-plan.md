# Doc-Talk Project Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the "Doc-Talk" chatbot.

## Phase 1: Foundational RAG with LangChain

This initial phase focuses on building the core Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) functionality for our "Doc-Talk" agent using LangChain.

### 1.1. Project Setup
- **Create Project Structure:**
  - Create a new directory named `doc-talk`.
  - Initialize a Python virtual environment.
- **Dependency Management:**
  - Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following libraries:
    - `langchain`
    - `langchain-google-genai`
    - `fastapi`
    - `uvicorn`
    - `python-dotenv`
    - `faiss-cpu` (for local vector storage)
    - `pypdf` (for PDF loading)
    - `python-docx` (for DOCX loading)

### 1.2. Core RAG Pipeline Development
- **Document Loading:**
  - Implement a module to load and parse text from various document formats (`.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`).
- **Text Chunking:**
  - Split the loaded documents into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks to prepare for embedding.
- **Embedding and Vector Storage:**
  - Use `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` from `langchain_google_genai` to create vector representations of the text chunks.
  - Store these embeddings in a FAISS vector store for efficient similarity searches.
- **Retrieval and Generation Chain:**
  - Build a LangChain chain that:
    1. Takes a user's query.
    2. Embeds the query.
    3. Retrieves the most relevant document chunks from the FAISS store.
    4. Passes the retrieved context and the original query to the Gemini LLM to generate a comprehensive answer.

### 1.3. API Development
- **Create a FastAPI Backend:**
  - Develop a simple web server with an endpoint (e.g., `/ask`) that accepts a POST request with the user's query.
  - The endpoint will process the query through the RAG pipeline and return the generated answer as a JSON response.

## Phase 2: Production-Ready Application

This phase focuses on creating a user-friendly interface and preparing the application for deployment.

### 2.1. Frontend Development
- **Build a User Interface:**
  - Create a simple web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a framework like Streamlit or Gradio) that allows users to:
    - Upload documents.
    - Interact with the "Doc-Talk" agent through a chat interface.
- **API Integration:**
  - Connect the frontend to the FastAPI backend to send queries and display the results.

### 2.2. Deployment
- **Containerization:**
  - Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application.
- **Cloud Deployment:**
  - Deploy the containerized application to a cloud platform like Google Cloud Run or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### Showcase and Iteration
- **Build in Public:** Document the development process through blog posts or a project portfolio.
- **User Feedback:** Gather feedback from users to iteratively improve the agent's performance and features.
