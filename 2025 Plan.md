# 2025 AI Agent Development Plan

This document outlines a phased approach to building a sophisticated AI agent, starting with a "Doc-Talk" chatbot and progressively adding more advanced features.

## Phase 1: Foundational RAG with LangChain

This phase focuses on building the "Doc-Talk" agent, a foundational RAG chatbot. The detailed plan for this phase is located in the [Doc-Talk Project Plan](./doc-talk/doc-talk-plan.md).

## Phase 2: Advanced Agentic Behavior with LangGraph

In this phase, we will enhance the agent's reasoning capabilities by implementing a stateful graph using LangGraph.

### 2.1. Refactor to a LangGraph Agent
- **Define Graph State:**
  - Create a state object that tracks the conversation history, the original question, retrieved documents, and the generated answer.
- **Implement Graph Nodes:**
  - **`retrieve`:** A node that performs the document retrieval.
  - **`grade_documents`:** A node that evaluates the relevance of the retrieved documents. If they are not relevant, it can trigger a `rewrite` node.
  - **`rewrite`:** A node that rephrases the user's question to improve retrieval results.
  - **`generate`:** A node that generates the final answer using the LLM.
- **Define Graph Edges:**
  - Create conditional edges to control the flow. For example, if `grade_documents` returns `not relevant`, the graph should loop back to the `rewrite` node.

### 2.2. Add Tools to the Agent
- **Web Search Tool:**
  - Integrate a web search tool (e.g., using the Tavily Search API) that the agent can use if the initial document search is insufficient.
  - The agent will be able to decide whether to use the document retriever or the web search tool based on the query.

## Phase 3: Production-Ready Application

This phase focuses on creating a user-friendly frontend and deploying the "Doc-Talk" application. The detailed plan for this phase is located in the [Doc-Talk Project Plan](./doc-talk/doc-talk-plan.md).
